# ACNR---Task-Quest1-reqruitment
Before ACNR started challenge recruitment there were only one task which now is called 
quest1 but before it was only this simple task without challenge. You have to decrypt 
encrypted message and doing next stuff like, decode base64, next scanning IP which was 
and finding magic port which is randomly generated every few minutes, next downloading with 
nc png file which we can check by simpy listening with nc. Another part png file is and qr 
code, thanks to it we have last task. Login to the website without creds. First the login we 
can find in code of website and there's a password part admin'or'1'='1. You can check this by 
executing exploit.py script or solution.py script.

Today with first part of challenge you have new part with flag, after decrypting:
